## Prompt 1

What are the main differences between Flexbox and Grid layouts? Describe scenarios where each layout system would be more suitable.

### Response 1
Flexbox is one-dimensional, used for arranging items in a row or column with control over the shifting and moving of items in relation to each other over either the main or cross axis. Grid is two-dimensional, using numerical coordinates for positioning in both rows and columns. Flexbox is most suitable when elements are in either a row or column and need to be aligned consistently. An example would be a navigation bar of evenly spaced elements in a row at the top of a page. Grid is most suitable when elements need to be arranged in both rows and columns, with some elements overlapping or of different sizes.

## Prompt 2

What is the difference between `justify-content` and `align-items` in Flexbox? How does each property control the positioning of flex items within the container?

### Response 2
`justify-content` is used to align flex items horizontally when not using all available space on the main axis. This can be used to position items at the start, end, or center of a container and can position items evenly with equal space between them or around them or with all extra space divided evenly to create a balanced layout. `align-items` is used to align flex items vertically when not using all available space on the cross axis. This can be used to align items to the start, end, or center of a container or to stretch items to fill a container.

## Prompt 3

Describe the difference between `grid-template-areas` and `grid-template-columns`/`grid-template-rows`. When might you prefer one approach over the other?

## Prompt 4

Explain the `min-width` and `max-width` keywords in media queries. How do they help create responsive breakpoints for different screen sizes?

### Response 4

## Prompt 5

Imagine you are teaching a brief lesson on **mobile first design**. Your lesson should include the following information:

* An explanation of mobile first design and a few of the benefits of this approach
* A CSS code example demonstrating how to use media queries to adjust the layout of a container from mobile to desktop with either Flexbox or Grid (choose one).
* An explanation of the code example.
